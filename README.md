# Linked List with C

Hello, I want to share my codes with you. I did some examples about type of linked list and dynamic array. I hope it helps you too...

## Hint
If you get error like this "collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status":

You should run "main.cpp" with the "stackArray.cpp" file. For example:

```
g++ -o main.exe main.cpp stackArray.cpp
```
Write this when you inside the file location in terminal.
